**Information current as of April 2025**

## What is Trello?

Trello is a highly visual, Kanban-style project and task management tool known for its simplicity and ease of use. Launched in 2011 and now owned by Atlassian, Trello uses a system of boards, lists, and cards to help individuals and teams organize projects, track tasks, and visualize workflow progress. It's designed to be intuitive and flexible for a wide range of applications.

## Core Philosophy

Trello's philosophy centers on "visual organization" and simplicity. It leverages the Kanban methodology – visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and focusing on flow – to make project management accessible and intuitive. The goal is to provide a clear, shared perspective on who is doing what and what needs to get done.

## Key Features

- **Boards, Lists, and Cards**
  - Unlimited cards on all plans
  - Drag-and-drop interface for moving cards between lists
  - Customizable lists representing workflow stages
  - Multiple boards for different projects or teams
  
- **Card Details**
  - Descriptions (with markdown support)
  - Checklists
  - Due dates and reminders
  - Labels for categorization
  - Member assignments
  - Attachments (local files, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
  - Comments for discussion

- **Automation (Butler)**
  - Rule-based automation for tasks (e.g., move card when checklist complete)
  - Button triggers for common actions
  - Calendar and due date commands
  - Email notifications and Slack integrations via automation

- **Power-Ups**
  - Integrations and feature enhancements (e.g., Custom Fields, Calendar view, integrations with Slack, Google Drive, etc.)
  - Free plan includes unlimited Power-Ups

## Free Plan Highlights

Trello offers a generous free plan that includes:
- Unlimited cards
- Up to 10 boards per Workspace
- Unlimited Power-Ups
- Unlimited storage (10MB per file limit)
- 250 Butler command runs per Workspace per month
- Unlimited activity log

Free plan limitations primarily involve the number of boards, advanced checklist features, certain view types (like Map view), and Butler automation limits.

## Best Suited For

- Teams preferring a highly visual workflow (Kanban)
- Small to medium-sized teams or projects
- Individuals managing personal tasks or projects
- Onboarding new team members quickly due to simplicity
- Situations where flexibility and ease of use are paramount

## Learning Curve Considerations

Trello has a very low learning curve, making it one ofthe easiest project management tools to adopt. Teams should consider:

- Defining clear meanings for lists (workflow stages)
- Establishing conventions for using labels and due dates
- Avoiding overly cluttered boards by archiving old cards/lists
- Exploring Power-Ups to add needed functionality
- Leveraging Butler automation for repetitive tasks

## Integration With Other Tools

Trello integrates with hundreds of tools via Power-Ups, including:
- Communication: Slack, Microsoft Teams
- File Storage: Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, OneDrive
- Development: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
- Planning: Calendar Power-Up, Planyway
- Automation: Zapier, IFTTT

## Complementary Tools

Trello is often paired with:
- Communication tools (Slack, Teams) for detailed discussions outside card comments
- Document collaboration platforms (Google Workspace, Notion) for extensive documentation
- Time tracking tools (Harvest, Clockify) integrated via Power-Ups
- More complex project management tools (like Jira, via Atlassian integration) for specific technical teams
