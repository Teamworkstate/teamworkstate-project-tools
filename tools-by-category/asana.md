**Information current as of April 2025**

## What is Asana?

Asana is a web and mobile work management platform designed to help teams organize, track, and manage their work, from small tasks to large strategic initiatives. It focuses on improving team collaboration and communication by providing clarity on who is doing what by when.

## Core Philosophy

Asana's philosophy revolves around providing **clarity** and **accountability** for teams. It aims to reduce "work about work" (like status update meetings, searching for information) by centralizing project details, communication, and progress tracking. It emphasizes connecting individual tasks and projects to larger company objectives (Goals) to ensure alignment and purpose.

## Key Features

-   **Tasks & Subtasks**: The fundamental building blocks, assignable with due dates, descriptions, comments, and attachments.
-   **Projects**: Collections of tasks, viewable in multiple formats:
    -   **List View**: Traditional to-do list format.
    -   **Board View**: Kanban-style board for visualizing workflow stages.
    -   **Timeline View**: Gantt-chart style view for project scheduling and dependency mapping (Paid feature).
    -   **Calendar View**: Tasks displayed on a monthly or weekly calendar.
-   **Portfolios**: Organize and monitor groups of related projects in one place, providing a high-level overview of progress and status (Paid feature).
-   **Goals**: Set, track, and manage company objectives (like OKRs), linking projects and tasks to show how work contributes to strategic goals (Paid feature).
-   **Workload**: Visualize team capacity and reassign tasks to prevent burnout and ensure balanced workloads (Paid feature).
-   **Rules (Automation)**: Automate routine tasks and workflows, such as assigning tasks, updating statuses, moving tasks between sections, or notifying stakeholders based on triggers.
-   **Forms**: Create standardized intake forms to capture work requests, bug reports, or other inputs, automatically turning submissions into tasks within Asana.
-   **Reporting & Dashboards**: Create customizable charts and dashboards to visualize project progress, team performance, and workload.
-   **Inbox**: Centralized notification center for updates on tasks and projects relevant to the user.
-   **Integrations**: Connects with numerous popular business tools.
-   **App (Mobile/Desktop)**: Access Asana on the go or via a dedicated desktop app.
