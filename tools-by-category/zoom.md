**Information current as of April 2025**

## What is Zoom?

Zoom is a cloud-based communications platform primarily known for its video conferencing service. It allows users to host and join online meetings, video webinars, and virtual events. Beyond video meetings, Zoom has expanded its offerings to include Zoom Phone (VoIP phone service), Zoom Chat (persistent team messaging), Zoom Rooms (conference room solutions), Zoom Events (platform for managing virtual and hybrid events), and other related services, aiming to provide a unified communication experience.

## Core Philosophy

Zoom's core philosophy revolves around making video communication "frictionless" and reliable. They prioritize ease of use, high-quality video and audio, and platform stability, enabling people to connect effectively regardless of their location or device. The goal is to facilitate collaboration and communication that feels natural and accessible, breaking down barriers to connection.

- Unlimited 1-on-1 meetings
- Group meetings limited to 40 minutes
- Standard video and audio quality
- Screen sharing, chat, virtual backgrounds, local recording

Free plan limitations primarily involve the 40-minute time limit on group meetings, caps on participant numbers (though 100 is generous), lack of cloud recording, and restricted access to advanced features like reporting, admin controls, webinars, and phone services.

## Best Suited For

- Remote and hybrid teams needing reliable video meetings
- Businesses conducting client calls and virtual presentations
- Educational institutions for online classes and virtual office hours

## Learning Curve Considerations

Zoom is widely regarded as having a very low learning curve for basic meeting participation and hosting. Its interface is intuitive for core functions. However:
- Mastering advanced features like webinar controls, breakout rooms, or complex scheduling requires some practice.
- Administering accounts for larger organizations involves a steeper learning curve for managing settings, users, and integrations.
- Understanding and configuring security settings properly is crucial.

## Integration With Other Tools

Zoom integrates with a wide array of tools through its App Marketplace, including:
- Calendaring: Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, Calendly
- Collaboration Suites: Google Workspace, Microsoft 365
- Project Management: Asana, Monday.com, ClickUp (often via scheduling or notifications)

## Complementary Tools

Zoom works well alongside:
- Collaboration platforms (Slack, Microsoft Teams) for persistent chat and broader project context
- Project management tools (Asana, Notion, ClickUp) for task tracking related to meetings
- Scheduling tools (Calendly, SavvyCal) for easier booking
- Document collaboration tools (Google Docs, Microsoft Word) for meeting notes and agendas
- Whiteboarding tools (Miro, FigJam) for more extensive visual collaboration than Zoom's built-in whiteboard
