*   **Category:** [Design & Visual Collaboration](../category-overview/design-visual-collaboration-overview.md)

## 1. Overview & Core Functionality

*   **What it is:** Miro is an expansive online whiteboard platform designed for visual collaboration. It provides an infinite canvas where teams can brainstorm, plan, design, map processes, run workshops, and collaborate in real-time or asynchronously.
*   **Primary Use Case:** Brainstorming, mind mapping, diagramming (flowcharts, user flows, system diagrams), strategy & planning, Agile workflows (retrospectives, PI planning), workshops & meetings, design thinking, user research synthesis.
*   **Key Differentiator:** Its vast, flexible canvas combined with a rich set of tools (sticky notes, shapes, arrows, drawing, templates, voting, timer, video chat) specifically designed for visual collaboration and workshop facilitation.

## 2. Key Features for Collaboration

*   **Infinite Canvas:** Provides a virtually limitless space for ideas and diagrams.
*   **Real-time Collaboration:** Multiple users can work on the same board simultaneously, with cursors visible.
*   **Templates:** Extensive library of pre-built templates for various use cases (brainstorming, retrospectives, journey mapping, flowcharts, etc.).
*   **Core Tools:** Sticky notes, shapes, connectors, text, freehand drawing, comments (@mentions).
*   **Diagramming Tools:** Tools specifically for creating flowcharts, UML diagrams, mind maps, org charts, etc.
*   **Workshop Facilitation:** Features like voting, timer, attention management (bring everyone to me), presentation mode, and embedded video chat support interactive sessions.
*   **Integration Widgets:** Embed content from other tools (Jira, Asana, Google Docs, etc.) directly onto the board.
*   **Frames:** Organize content into distinct areas, which can be navigated like slides or exported.

## 3. Pricing & Free Tier Details

*   **Free Tier Availability:** Yes.
*   **Free Tier Limitations:** Unlimited team members, 3 editable boards, core tools, pre-made templates, core integrations (Slack, Teams, etc.).

Boards created by others that you join don't count towards your 3-board limit.
*   **Paid Tiers Start At:** Approximately $8 USD/member/month (billed annually) for the "Starter" tier.

## 4. Ideal Use Cases & Target Audience

*   **Best Suited For:** Teams needing a flexible visual space for collaboration, especially remote or distributed teams. Product managers, designers, developers, Agile coaches, consultants, workshop facilitators, educators, and marketing teams.
*   **May NOT Be Ideal For:** Teams primarily needing structured task or project management (though it integrates with those tools). Users looking for a simple note-taking or document creation tool (might be overkill). Situations requiring highly structured data management (like Airtable).

## 5. Strengths

*   **Flexibility & Versatility:** The open canvas can be adapted to almost any visual collaboration task.
*   **Rich Toolset:** Offers a comprehensive suite of tools for brainstorming, diagramming, and facilitating workshops.
*   **Real-time Collaboration:** Smooth and effective multi-user experience.
*   **Extensive Template Library:** Accelerates setup for common use cases.
*   **Strong Integrations:** Connects well with many popular business and productivity tools, bringing context onto the board.
*   **Engaging for Workshops:** Features like voting, timer, and video chat make online workshops more interactive.

## 6. Potential Drawbacks / Limitations

*   **Can Be Overwhelming:** The sheer number of tools and infinite canvas can be intimidating for new users.
*   **Performance on Large Boards:** Very large, complex boards with many elements can sometimes experience performance lag, especially on lower-spec machines.
*   **Free Tier Board Limit:** The 3-editable-board limit on the free tier can be restrictive for ongoing use across multiple projects.
*   **Cost:** Can become expensive for large teams needing paid features. Managing occasional collaborators requires the Business plan or higher.

## 7. Integration Potential

*   **Key Integrations:** Jira, Asana, Trello, Azure DevOps, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Workspace (Drive), Zoom, Figma, Sketch, Adobe Creative Cloud, Confluence, Zapier, Make (Integromat). Many integrations allow embedding live content or two-way sync (e.g., Jira cards).
*   **API Availability:** Yes, Miro provides a REST API and a Web SDK for building custom integrations and applications on top of the platform.

## 8. Getting Started & Learning Curve

*   **Ease of Setup:** Simple to sign up and start using basic features like sticky notes and text.
*   **Learning Curve:** Moderate. Basic usage is easy, but mastering advanced features, diagramming tools, facilitation features, and structuring boards effectively takes practice. The template library helps flatten the curve.
*   **Support Resources:** Miro Academy (courses, videos), Help Center (knowledge base), Community Forum, Blog, Webinars.
