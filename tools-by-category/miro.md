# Miro

**Information current as of April 2025**

## What is Miro?

Miro is an online collaborative whiteboard platform designed for teams to brainstorm, ideate, plan, and collaborate visually in real-time or asynchronously. Launched initially as RealtimeBoard in 2011 and rebranded as Miro in 2019, it provides an infinite canvas where teams can create diagrams, map out processes, run workshops, and manage projects visually.

## Core Philosophy

Miro's philosophy centers on providing a "shared space for visual collaboration" where ideas can flow freely without the constraints of traditional documents or slides. It aims to replicate the experience of a physical whiteboard online, enhanced with digital capabilities, making it easy for distributed teams to co-create, align, and understand complex information visually.

## Key Features

- **Infinite Canvas & Templates**
  - Vast, zoomable canvas for unlimited workspace
  - Extensive template library (e.g., mind maps, Kanban boards, flowcharts, retrospectives, user story maps)
  - Custom template creation

- **Collaboration Tools**
  - Real-time cursors and collaboration
  - Sticky notes, shapes, connectors, text, and drawing tools
  - Voting and timer tools for workshops
  - Comments, mentions, and chat functionality
  - Video chat within the board

- **Visual Thinking Tools**
  - Mind mapping capabilities
  - Diagramming tools (flowcharts, UML, BPMN)
  - Wireframing and mock-up elements
  - Kanban board creation within the canvas

- **Integration & Embedding**
  - Embedding documents, images, videos, and web links
  - Integrations with tools like Jira, Asana, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Notion, Google Workspace
  - Miro boards can be embedded in other platforms

## Free Plan Highlights

Miro offers a free plan that includes:
- 3 editable boards
- Unlimited team members (viewers/commenters/editors on free boards)
- Core integrations (Slack, Teams, etc.)
- Basic templates
- Basic attention management tools (bring collaborators to you)

Free plan limitations focus primarily on the number of editable boards, access to advanced features (like custom templates, high-resolution exports, Jira cards, voting), and project/privacy controls.

## Best Suited For

- Remote or hybrid teams needing a shared visual workspace
- Brainstorming sessions, ideation, and design thinking workshops
- Process mapping, flowcharting, and system diagramming
- Agile ceremonies like retrospectives and sprint planning
- Visual project planning and roadmapping

## Learning Curve Considerations

Miro has a relatively low learning curve for basic whiteboard functions, but mastering its full range of features takes time. Teams should consider:

- Starting with templates to understand possibilities
- Establishing board organization and naming conventions
- Learning navigation shortcuts for large boards
- Utilizing frameworks (like mind maps or flowcharts) effectively
- Setting norms for real-time vs. asynchronous collaboration on boards

## Integration With Other Tools

Miro integrates deeply with many tools, including:
- **Project Management**: Jira, Asana, ClickUp, Azure DevOps, Rally
- **Communication**: Slack, Microsoft Teams
- **Design**: Figma, Sketch, Adobe Creative Cloud
- **Documentation**: Confluence, Notion, Google Workspace
- **Video Conferencing**: Zoom

## Complementary Tools

Miro is often used alongside:
- **Task Management Tools** (ClickUp, Trello, Asana) where Miro boards are used for planning and ideation, linking to specific tasks.
- **Communication Platforms** (Slack, Teams) for quick chats while collaborating on a Miro board.
- **Documentation Tools** (Notion, Confluence) where Miro boards are embedded to visualize concepts explained in text.
- **Video Conferencing Tools** (Zoom, Google Meet) for running facilitated workshops using Miro as the interactive space.
