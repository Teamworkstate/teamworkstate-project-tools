# Slack

**Information current as of April 2025**

## What is Slack?

Slack is a channel-based messaging platform designed for team communication and collaboration. Launched in 2013, it has become one of the most widely-adopted team communication tools, positioning itself as an alternative to email for internal team interactions. Slack's core focus is organizing team conversations into channels for specific topics, projects, or teams.

## Core Philosophy

Slack's approach centers on "organized communication" - structuring conversations into searchable, topic-specific channels rather than fragmented email threads or chats. The platform aims to make communication transparent, searchable, and organized while integrating the tools teams already use into the conversation flow.

## Key Features

- **Channel-based Communication**
  - Public channels for team-wide topics
  - Private channels for sensitive discussions
  - Direct messages for one-on-one communication
  - Group DMs for small team conversations
  
- **Message Organization**
  - Threaded replies to keep discussions focused
  - Message pins and bookmarks
  - Message editing and deletion
  - Emoji reactions for quick responses
  - Saved items for personal reference

- **File Sharing & Search**
  - Drag-and-drop file sharing
  - Rich file previews
  - Advanced search across messages and files
  - Search modifiers and filters
  - Archive access

- **Workflow Enhancements**
  - Custom status messages
  - Scheduled messages
  - Reminders
  - Channel topics and descriptions
  - Keyboard shortcuts

## Free Plan Highlights

Slack offers a free plan that includes:
- Unlimited users
- 10K searchable message history (most recent only)
- 10 integrations with other apps
- One-to-one voice and video calls

Free plan limitations focus primarily on message history, file storage (5GB total), and the number of integrations.

## Best Suited For

- Teams seeking to reduce internal email volume
- Organizations that value transparent communication
- Collaborative groups working across different locations or time zones
- Projects requiring quick back-and-forth discussion
- Teams using multiple tools that benefit from integration

## Learning Curve Considerations

Slack has a relatively low learning curve for basic use. Teams should consider:

- Creating clear channel naming conventions from the start
- Establishing team norms around notification settings to prevent overload
- Training team members on thread usage to keep channels organized
- Setting expectations for response times
- Developing guidelines for what belongs in Slack vs. other communication tools
