# Microsoft 365

**Information current as of April 2025**

## What is Microsoft 365?

Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365) is Microsoft's subscription-based service that bundles its core Office applications (like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook) with cloud services like OneDrive, SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams. It aims to provide a comprehensive productivity and collaboration platform for individuals, businesses, and enterprises, integrating desktop software with cloud-based capabilities.

## Core Philosophy

Microsoft 365's philosophy centers on providing a powerful, integrated productivity experience that spans desktop, web, and mobile devices. It leverages the familiarity and deep functionality of its traditional Office desktop applications while enhancing them with cloud storage, real-time collaboration features (co-authoring), and integrated communication via Teams and Outlook. It aims to be the central hub for an organization's documents, communication, and internal processes, particularly within the Windows ecosystem.

## Key Features (Core Apps & Services)

- **Outlook**: Professional email and calendar client. Includes scheduling assistant, shared mailboxes/calendars, integration with Teams and To Do. Available as desktop, web, and mobile apps.
- **OneDrive for Business**: Cloud storage and file synchronization. Personal storage for business users, file sharing, integration with Office apps and Teams, offline access.
- **SharePoint Online**: Team collaboration sites, document libraries, intranets, lists, and workflow automation (Power Automate). Acts as the backend storage for files shared in Teams.
- **Microsoft Teams**: Hub for teamwork. Includes chat, channels, video meetings, file sharing (backed by SharePoint/OneDrive), app integrations, and calling capabilities (with appropriate licenses).
- **Word**: Advanced word processing. Available as powerful desktop application, web app, and mobile app. Features include real-time co-authoring, track changes, comments, templates.

## Free Plan Highlights (Consumer vs. Business)

Similar to Google, Microsoft offers free consumer versions of some services (Outlook.com email, basic OneDrive storage, free web/mobile versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, free version of Teams for personal use). However, **Microsoft 365** for business is a paid subscription service. Key advantages of the paid business plans include:
- Custom business email domain (@yourcompany.com) via Exchange Online.
- Full installable desktop versions of Office apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, etc.) on multiple devices per user.
- Significantly larger OneDrive storage (starting at 1TB/user).
- SharePoint for team sites and document management.
- Full-featured Microsoft Teams for business collaboration.
- Advanced security and compliance features.
- Centralized administration via the Admin Center.
- 24/7 support and uptime SLAs.

There isn't a "free tier" of the comprehensive Microsoft 365 business suite.

## Best Suited For

- Organizations deeply integrated with the Windows and Microsoft ecosystem.
- Enterprises requiring robust security, compliance, and administration features.
- Teams needing the advanced features and offline capabilities of desktop Office applications.
- Businesses using SharePoint for intranets or complex document management.
- Organizations leveraging other Microsoft services like Azure, Dynamics 365, or Power Platform.
- Companies migrating from traditional on-premises Office licenses.

## Learning Curve Considerations

- Most users are familiar with core Office apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook desktop).
- The learning curve often involves:
  - Transitioning to cloud storage (OneDrive/SharePoint) and understanding sharing permissions.
  - Mastering Microsoft Teams for communication and collaboration (channels, chat, meetings, file management).
  - Understanding the relationship between Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive.
  - Utilizing co-authoring and other cloud collaboration features effectively.
  - For Admins: Navigating the comprehensive Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

## Integration With Other Tools

Microsoft 365 integrates heavily with its own ecosystem (Azure, Dynamics 365, Power Platform) and offers numerous third-party integrations via the Teams App Store and Microsoft AppSource. Common integrations include:
