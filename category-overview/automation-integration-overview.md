# Overview: Automation & Integration Tools

Tools in this category specialize in connecting different software applications and automating workflows between them without requiring custom code. They allow users to create "if this, then that" scenarios (often called Zaps, recipes, or flows) to move data and trigger actions across various apps, saving time and reducing manual effort. These platforms are crucial for creating seamless processes across a diverse tool stack.
